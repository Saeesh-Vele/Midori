## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Climate change is real, but individual action often feels overwhelming. People want to help the environment but don't know:
- **Where** to recycle specific items
- **How much** carbon they're actually producing
- **What** alternatives exist for their daily habits
- **Who** to connect with for motivation and support

**EcoFy bridges this gap** by making sustainability accessible, social, and even fun.
